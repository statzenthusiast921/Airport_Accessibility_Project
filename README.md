# Airport Accessibility Project

### Description

The goal of this project was to examine the accessibility of continents, countries, and cities by visualizing where to find all airports in the world.  This started as a Tableau dashboard in early 2020 and I eventually converted my work to an R Shiny app later in the year.


### Data

I found all of my data for this analysis from the link [here](https://openflights.org/data.html) for the OpenFlights Airport Database.  As of January 2017, this database contains over 10,000 airports, train stations and ferry terminals spanning the globe.  The two datasets used for this analysis can be found at the links below:

- [All Airports](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpatokal/openflights/master/data/airports-extended.dat)
- [All Routes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpatokal/openflights/master/data/routes.dat)


### Limitations

These datasets are not exhaustive lists of every airport in the world.  Further, this data has not been updated since 2014, so certain routes that are currently available may not be reflected in this analysis.
