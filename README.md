# Airport Accessibility Project

### Description

The goal of this project was to examine the accessibility of continents, countries, and cities by visualizing where to find all airports in the world.  This started as a Tableau dashboard in early 2020 and I eventually converted my work to an R Shiny app later in the year.


### Data

I found all of my data for this analysis from link here for [OpenFlights Airport Database](https://openflights.org/data.html).  As of January 2017, this database contains over 10,000 airports, train stations and ferry terminals spanning the globe.  The two datasets used for this analysis can be found at the links below:

- [All Airports](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpatokal/openflights/master/data/airports-extended.dat)
- [All Routes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpatokal/openflights/master/data/routes.dat)
